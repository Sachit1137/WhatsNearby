# WhatsNearby
It allows Android devices to locate nearby places like restaurants, cafe's, hospitals, etc. using GPS location. The user can also enter the place manually to get it's information. Integration of weather updates with nearby location makes this app unique as the user does not have to switch apps. This whole project has been designed using Java programming language in Android Studio.
